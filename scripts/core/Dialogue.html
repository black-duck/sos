<!--Description of the main storyline-->
<div id="storyline">
<b><p>Year 2150..</p></b>
<p>After years of wars and conflict, <br>
the biggest military forces on earth, <br>
unleased what humanity feared for a <br>
long time.. A world-wide nuclear war! </p>

<b><p>Now..</p></b>
<p>Two years later, the majority of all <br>
living beings has been driven extinct. <br>
All cities turned to ruin, the land became <br>
polluted and what was left of humanity <br>
created underwater safehouses in order to <br>
preserve life on earth. They used what was <br>
left of old military submarines for transport <br>
and protection against the dangers of the ocean..</p>

You are the captain of one of these submarines. <br>
Reach the nearest safehouse in time and save<br>
yourself and your crew!
